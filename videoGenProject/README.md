# Goal of the project

The videoGen project consists firstly in implementing an application based on a DSL grammar to generate videos, the generated videos are the result of specification model, source videos and some filters and transformations. The second part of the project aims to integrate the generator into a website in order to provide a more user-friendly interface.


# Use

1. Generator: just run the main class(from eclipse for example) and follow the instructions in the READEME generator folder
2. VideoGenWeb: the ./mvnw command is used to launch the website in dev mode. For more details there is a READEME too in videoGenWeb

# Some technologies and tools used
- [Xtext / Xtend] - to implement our DSL
- [Jhipster] - to generate the web site
- [Bootstap / AngularJS / HTML] - for the frontend
- [Spring] - for the backend
- [node.js] - event I / O for the backend
- [Gulp] - the streaming build systems
