# Goal of the project

The videoGen project consists firstly in implementing a program that is based on a textual specification and source videos to generate videos that meet the specifications. The second part of the project aims to integrate the generator into a website in order to provide a more user-friendly interface.


# Use

1. Generator: just run the main class(from eclipse for example) and follow the instructions in the READEME generator folder
2. VideoGenWeb: the ./mvnw command is used to launch the website in dev mode. For more details there is a READEME too in videoGenWeb
